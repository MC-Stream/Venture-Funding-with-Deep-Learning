# Venture Funding with Deep Learning

Alphabet Soup is a venture capital firm. Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. This team has requested a notebook to help them create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The business team has provided a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Using the provided dataset, this notebook will create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business. The CSV file (applicants_data.csv) contains a variety of information about these businesses, including whether or not they ultimately became successful.

## Technologies

This project utilizes a lot of different add ons, please make sure you have all these and they are up to date:

* [JupyterLab 3.4.4](https://jupyter.org/) - For the notebook creation and running of the code.

* [pandas 1.4.3](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/README.md) - For reading the csv files and other operations.

* [numpy](https://https://numpy.org/) - Loaded in, used in a few the operations...maybe?

* [scikit-learn v1.1.1](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) - For scaling the data.

* [TensorFlow 2.10.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - For Modelling of the AI.

* [Keras 2.10.0](https://keras.io/about/) - Some of the options used in TensorFlow.

## Usage

To access the credit risk notebook, please begin by typing jupyter lab in your terminal. 

```python
jupyter lab
```

Next, find the folder with the notebook(venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb) and double click it to open the notebook in a new launcher. Then, begin running through each section of the application to get the appropriate data.

Once in the notebook it will take you through a step-by-step process as it Collects the Data, Prepares the Data, and Analyzes the Data.
The model accuracy will be listed at the end and all model files will be saved in the Resources folder. Access the one that you feel grants the best results of the 3.

We do believe everything is thoroughly explained in the notebook, but please let us know if you have any further questions.
